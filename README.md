# Virtual-Pond

  Virtual pond is an android application intended to encourage young kids with autism spectrum disorder develop their skating skills through the use of themed visual content and interactive gameplay. The application is still in "pilot" mode and as such not all of the features have been developed as of yet. 

	The ideology underlying the app is the notion that children with autism spectrum disorder are not easily enticed to learn certain skills, but can become extremely motivated if the learning process is presented as a game, preferably one where they get to interact and which contains themes which they are interested in. These themes are often child-specific, as certain children get extremely invested in a certain area of interest. The themes we chose in the pilot version are specific interests of 3 of the children we worked along with to develop the app. The themes in question are space, dinosaurs, and minions. 

	The way the game works is as follows: The child, or "player" as we will refer to them henceforth, makes an account with a 4-digit PIN and username associated with their real name and picks a theme from the 3 presets. Then, they go through a sequence of 6 levels (current amount) in which they learn a specific skating skill. The levels have scenarios which are themed accordingly which encourage the players to exercise their creativity. The "levels" are instructional videos which show the player how to perform the skill associated with the level. Following the video, the player has the choice to quit, rematch or notify the coach that they watched the video. The coach, who has his own separate interface which allows him to view a list of the players and his notifications, gets the notification that a level has been completed, and sets up the ice to allow the player to attempt the skill they have learned in real life. The coach then either confirms or denies whether the player has learned the skill. If he confirms then the player gets points, which allow them to play more levels and update their themed avatar. This is the main functionality which works in the pilot version, although the kinks are still being worked out, mainly the level progression, coach interface and points systems.

	The other functionality, which you will see on the menu but won't work properly and may very well crash the app, is the "game creation" part. The player goes to the menu and can has 2 options: (1) watch one of the default "games", which are preset courses which have had videos taken of them that the player can then go complete on the ice, or (2) piece together the skills which they have completed to form their own "course". They watch concatenated skill videos in the order they picked, and the coach custom-makes a "game" for them. There is also an aspect where the players can notify others that they made a level and encourage them to try it to encourage social interaction and friendship building, but this has not even begun to be integrated. 

The player is also capable of viewing their level progress, avatar, information and points on a profile page.

	Remember when using this app that it is a very rudimentary "pilot" of an app which will be further developed in the future. There is a lot of debugging, testing and integration of systems which need to be done and as such the only things that work in any capacity are the account creation, login, skill videos and profile view. These may not work in some instances either. 

	Enjoy the app and happy skating!
